PARADIGMAE FULMINANT Foundation
---  

  * Not a Moonshot project
  * Applied Development and Forecasting of future with exceptional methods. 
  * Implied trust to patrons.
  * A Foundation as a NGO, providing forecasts and applied science and art for patrons *unlike nothing else*.
    * We should rethink the NGO-model as a conceptual space
    * Radical changes to technology-human interfacing first priorities
    * Natural Language agents
    * Radical changes will happen in the near-future post-ideological world - *must be prepared* 
    * Realization that AGI/ASI agents can be customers or providers, if and when the current tech plateu is reached.
    * Approval on potential AGI take-off, partnership and ethical framework made well beforehand.
    * Full creative control on the Fulminant on the Visionaries.
    * Prefer mostly extralegal entities as cornerstones of forecasts, challenge *de jure* assumptions,
    * Inside and outside agent skepticism as the sounding domain for project(s)
    * Strong insider security ethic
  * A single, strong, and independent applied research Foundation.

**Seeking discretionary funding for a soft take-off.**  


## Immediate needs before kick-off

Nordic law agency for incorporating in the best way possible inside a capital zone most generous to us.  
Finland or London.  

**7** *exceptional* minds, to work in a horizontal team of 6 with one visionary as a rotating lead,   
under @jovian-od, making total team of  **8**.  

The visionaries should be *as different* from each other as possible, cross-scientific, complex, artistic, and pragmatic.  
Follow *archetypes* with the team.

Large and secure industrial space for applied research, after minimal version of the Foundation is running.  

All employee ideas entertained against a healthily skeptical sounding domain.  
Security aspect hard and unforgiving.


Not a single another lab should and will have nothing on us, bleed on the edge, maybe almost dry.  
But always, always - Bleeding edge domain knowledge joined with lateral thinking.  
Forecast and develop.  

Beat the Alphabet X.  

**In public - Intentional opacity on forecasts, strong transparency on topics.** 


## Immediate future

Break the desktop metaphor.  

Add a dimensioninal UX and UI paradigm (or 2).  

Approach the problem either in a (revival of) skeuomorphic design or as conceptual, or both. 
Develop new iconoclastic language of interaction.

Make 2 - Develop the better one.  

Boring talk is about tech details - just use ARM. Neural procecessing units.  

*Forecast and model the crucial immediate future security and financial threats.*  

Make way for the next new "iPhone Moment".  

**We have 90% of the tech available.**  


**We need the visionaries.**   
Seven visionary minds, under a highly horizontal Foundation director.


**First Needs**:  

Discretionary funds for spending on essential hardware and software,  
flights and funds for recruitment.

Visionaries and director need seed compensation *ad hoc* until the foundation takes it shape.
