PARADIGMAE FULMINANT Foundation
---  

  * Not a Moonshot project
    * We should rethink those as a conceptual space
    * Radical changes to technology-human interfacing
    * Natural Language agents
    * Radical changes in the near-future post-ideological world - *must be prepared* 
    * Realization that AGI/ASI agents can be customers or providers, if and when the plateu is reached.
    * Approval on potential AGI take-off, partnership and ethical framework made well beforehand.
    * Full creative control to the Fulminant
    * Prefer mostly extralegal entities as cornerstones
    * Inside and outside agent skepticism as the sounding domain for project(s)
    * Strong insider security ethic
  * A single, strong, and independent applied research Foundation.

**Seeking discretionary funding for a soft take-off.**  


## Immediate needs before kick-off

Nordic law agency for incorporating in the best way possible inside a capital zone most generous to us.  

7 *exceptional* minds, to work in a horizontal team under @jovian-od.  

All employee ideas entertained against sounding domain.  

Not a single lab should and will have nothing on us, bleed on the edge, maybe almost dry.  
But always, always - Bleeding edge domain knowledge joined with lateral thinking.  

Beat the Alphabet X.  
  
Security aspect hard and unforgiving.


## Immediate future

Break the desktop metaphor.  

Add a dimensioninal UX and UI paradigm (or 2).  

Approach the problem either in a (revival of) skeuomorphic design or as conceptual, or both. 
Develop new iconoclastic language of interaction.

Make 2 - Develop the better one.  

Boring tech base - just use ARM. Neural procecessing.  

Make way for the next new "iPhone Moment".  

We have 90% of the tech available.  
We need the visionaries.   
Seven visionary minds, under a highly horizontal Foundation director.


**First Needs**:  

Need of some physical space, secure and dimensional.  

Discretionary funds for spending on essential hardware and software,  

Visionaries, director need seed compensation, and R&R by case.
